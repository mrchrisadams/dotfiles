These dotfiles are an attempt to create some reusable dotfiles acros the boxes I use, from a base where I understand everything that's happening inside my shell, instead of jumping into the extremely developed config files from another developer.

The initial starting point for this was ryanb's dotfiles, which I've since ripped out, because all the magic was fun, but ultimately I didn't know what on earth was happening under the hood.
